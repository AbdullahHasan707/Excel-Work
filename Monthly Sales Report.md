Monthly Sales Report (Excel Project)

- <a herf="https://github.com/AbdullahHasan707/Excel-Work/blob/main/Monthly-Sales-Report%20executed.xlsx">Dataset view</a>

Developed a comprehensive Monthly Sales Report in Excel to track and analyze sales performance across different periods and regions. Applied formulas and calculations to evaluate revenue, growth trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Enhanced the dataset with formatting, pivot tables, and charts to transform raw sales figures into clear, actionable business insights. This project demonstrates my ability to use Excel for data cleaning, financial reporting, and decision support.
